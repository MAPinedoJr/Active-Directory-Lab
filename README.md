# Active Directory Home Lab

## Objective

The Active Directory Home Lab project is aimed to create a controlled domain environment to explore and understand the workings of Active Directory. This environment included the integration of Splunk, Kali Linux for penetration testing, and Atomic Red Team for simulating real-world attacks. The primary focus was to centralize and analyze logs within the SIEM (Splunk) by generating test telemetry to mimic actual attack scenarios. This hands-on project was designed to deepen understanding of domain environments, network security and attacks and provide practical experience.

### Skills Learned

- Understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate attacks.
- Knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Critical thinking and problem-solving skills in Blue Teaming and general IT.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (Splunk) system for log analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools (Crowbar, Atomic Red Team) to create realistic attack scenarios.
- Database of users promoted to a domain controller (Active Directory).
